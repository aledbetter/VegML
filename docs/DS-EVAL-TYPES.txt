// Dataset types and Eval types

// Classification & logic
	- segment - set of data tuned to a single value
		sizes vary, value can be boolean, tag, etc
		common: sentiment, image classification, extended for Q&A
		
	- stream - stream of data where running eval determines at any point that there is a match
		multiple classifications can be evaluted, steam continues after 'segement' classification within it
		probability of any tag can be 'asked' at any time
	
	- block - set of framed data where all relationships are within the frame AND each block is 1 frame AND there is not focus
		common: AND/OR/XOR, logic, math
	
	- sequence - set of framed data where all relationships are within the frame, and there is a value for the focus
		- the relationships in the model determine if a sequence or a block of values
		common POS, text classification
		


// methods
	- segments and streams can be evalued down to a block that can be re-evaled
	- streams can be evaluted with segment method, sequence or both
